# A Column Adapter for the Ioptron Tri-pier

I wanted to mount a USB3 hub on my Ioptron Tri-pier. There are holes
on the pier that I can use to mount the hub. However, I didn't like
mounting a flat surface of the hub to the round surface of the pier
directly. I wasn't able to find such an adapter or even a 3D printed
one. So I made a set of column adapters for my hub that I think will
be useful for others.

Here's how my adapter and hub mounted on the
pier looks like:

## The adapters

The pair of adapters after 3D printing are shown here:

![tripier column adapters](https://github.com/cytan299/tripier_adapter/blob/master/pics/IMG_1923.jpg)

Each set consists of
* **(a)** 2 column adapters that has a hole and a slot for 1/4"-20 bolts.
* **(b)** 2 saddle washers for securing the adapter to the pier.

Here's a photo of the adapter with the bolts that I used:
* **(a)** 1/4"-20 1/2" socket heat bolt for securing the adapter to the
pier together with the saddle washer.
* **(b)** 1/4"-20 3/4" button head bolt for securing the hub to the adapter.

## Notes

These column adapters should be compatible with other 6" piers like
the [Astro-Physics 6" Eagle Adjustable Folding Pier](http://www.astro-physics.com/index.htm?products/accessories/mounting_acc/piers).
