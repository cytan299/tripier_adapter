# Ioptron Tri-pier column adapter source code

![Ioptron Tri-pier column adapter](https://github.com/cytan299/tripier_adapter/blob/master/pics/tripier_adapter.png)

This is the source code for column adapter that I designed for the
Ioptron Tri-pier adaptor. I believe this adapter should work for all
piers that have a diameter of 6 inches, for example the Astro-Physics
6" Eagle Adjustable Folding Pier.

The source is written in [Openscad](http://www.openscad.org). The
_stl_ file can be found in the _adapter_stl_ directory.
