# Ioptron Tri-pier column adapter

![Ioptron Tri-pier column adapter](https://github.com/cytan299/tripier_adapter/blob/master/pics/tripier_adapter.png)

This is the column adapter that I designed for the Ioptron Tri-pier. I
believe this adapter should work for all piers that have a diameter of
6 inches, for example the Astro-Physics 6" Eagle Adjustable Folding
Pier.

The source code for generating the case can be found in the
_adapter_source_ directory.

The file *tripier_adapter.stl* file can be uploaded to [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com) for manufacture. The material that I used is

* Black Strong & Flexible.
* "Inches" is the dimensions that has to be specified during upload
